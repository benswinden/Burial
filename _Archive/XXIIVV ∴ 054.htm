• Your are <b>a student</b> in our network adventure Dilitriel, it's a text based (<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/069">IDMU</a>) Infinitely Defined Multiuser Universe. <br><br>

I shook the rain from my wet coat and hung it to the back of my chair, sat and readied the terminal. I threw a bag full of cans of food across the dark studio onto my new bunk bed. The atonal noise of the readying screen was followed by a projected light, brightening part of the room. And I expired a week worth of air and filled in the blinking login form. A few of my friends who came back from school faster, were already at the Obelisk in Septambres. Soon enough, this rainy friday night was but a shadow in a dream that you can't quite make sense of.<br><br>

From the routine of starting the terminal and throwing food on my bed, I could not have guessed that this friday was unlike all the preceding ones. But this fridays was special, it was the friday that I died in-game.<br><br>

I didn't know anyone who had died before, and nobody within my network even knew what that meant, to die. We had this vague idea that, the login form would reject your ID and you would stay in this world of rain for ever. There is no way that I can live without seeing my friends inside Septambres again. By monday morning, I could not take it anymore and I jumped in front of the  morning train.<br><br>

• Your are <b>a business person</b> in our network adventure Nohlxeserre, it's a text based (IDMU) Infinitely Defined Multiuser Universe. <br><br>

The screen read "End" and I felt my dry coat hung behind me. I was still making sense that I won't be able to connect to go to school again. I tried to recall fragments of the memories from Dilitriel but they were only dissipating pieces that were soon grotesque images of something that must have been a wonderful story. Not being able to see my school mates inside of Dilitriel was a insufferable ache and all memories of Septambres forgotten, and so I took my coat from the back of my rusted chair and jumped in front of the first train at 831:00:82.<br><br>

• Your are <b>an old person</b> in our network adventure Ju'Nev, it's a text based (IDMU) Infinitely Defined Multiuser Universe. <br><br>

The blinking form of Nohlxeserre rejected my password for the first time. The sounds of the old terminal fan was resonating in my dusty bedroom and in my head, melting into a suffocating noise. My old hands moved away from the keyboard and landed on my laps. I took a moment to raise from the chair, grabbed my coat and walked to the docks. I knew that I would never be able to go to see my friends in Nohlxeserre again, and so I jumped in front of the first train.<br><br>

• Your are <b>about to die</b> in our network adventure Heaven, it's a text based (IDMU) Infinitely Defined Multiuser Universe. <br><br>

The terminal shut down, and my eyes hardly adjusted to the invisible room engulfed in darkness. I could feel the skin of my knees through the holes in my ripped jeans, I could feel my wrinkled fingerprints on my rough knee. I looked at the rain and left; I did not bring my coat along. <br><br>

Outside, I had a vague souvenirs of something that I did not know, like a confusing dream. The foggy memory of something that barely makes sense. I was floating in space in as a kid, next to an immense rocklike structure with people I don't seem to remember, but knew at that point were friends. I jumped in front of the first train at a9:k4:ve on this endlessly raining day. </content>
